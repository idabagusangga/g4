# Introduction

This is the test for front end position in gaspack. The instruction is to 
create a movie list with detail page. The requirements are React, Axios and Redux.

I dont feel the need to use a state management package so i excluded Redux on this test.

# Live links
Because the website is served over https, it cannot call api from http. You will see a blank list with a search bar.

To handle this, in your chrome browser, right next to the url, you will see a lock icon.
click on the lock icon >> site settings >> insecure content >> change it into allow
